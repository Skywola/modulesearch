# modulesearch
This is a console search program that allows you to use the console to search, as opposed to going to the API.

Options for what you can search are:
1. numpy                            2. pandas        3. plotly          4. matplotlib
5. matplotlib.pyplot           6. seaborn       7. sklearn        8. sympy

Usage is simple:   search(4, "path")

This Imports any module you search!

See the notes at the top of the file for more info.   

I will likely be upgrading this periodically to make it more powerful!
